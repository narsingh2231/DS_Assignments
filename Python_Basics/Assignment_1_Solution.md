# 2. What is the difference between string and variable?

Answer: - Variables are symbols that you can use to store data in a program. You can think of them as an empty box that you fill with some data or value. Strings are data, so we can use them to fill up a variable. Declaring strings as variables can make it easier for us to work with strings throughout our Python programs.

# 10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?

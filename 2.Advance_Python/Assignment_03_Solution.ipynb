        "\n",
        "* The concept of an abstract superclass is closely related to the idea of abstraction in object-oriented programming (OOP). In OOP, abstraction is a fundamental principle that allows you to define a common interface or set of attributes and methods for a group of related classes, without providing a concrete implementation for some or all of those methods in the abstract class.\n",
        "\n",
        "* An abstract superclass, also known as an abstract base class (ABC), is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own. It serves as a blueprint for its subclasses, providing a common structure and interface that those subclasses must adhere to. The abstract superclass typically contains abstract methods, which are methods without a complete implementation, and concrete methods that have a defined behavior.\n",

        "1. Cannot be instantiated: You cannot create objects directly from an abstract superclass. Instead, you must create instances of its concrete subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. May contain abstract methods: Abstract methods are declared in the abstract superclass without providing an implementation. These methods act as placeholders that must be implemented in the concrete subclasses. This enforces a contract, ensuring that all subclasses implement certain behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. May contain concrete methods: In addition to abstract methods, an abstract superclass can also have concrete methods. Concrete methods have a complete implementation and can be directly called by the concrete subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Establishes a common interface: By defining abstract methods, the abstract superclass establishes a set of methods that its subclasses must have. This allows clients of the subclasses to use the same interface when interacting with objects of different subclasses.\n",

However, the superclass's `__init__` method (constructor) is not automatically called when creating an instance of the subclass. As a result, if the superclass has important initialization logic in its constructor, the subclass needs to manually call the superclass's `__init__` method to ensure that the initialization is properly performed for both the subclass and the superclass.\n",

This ensures that the entire inheritance chain is properly initialized.\n",
